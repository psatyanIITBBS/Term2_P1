# Project 1 - Term2
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

In this project we have written a kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. Passing the project requires obtaining RMSE values that are lower than the tolerance outlined in the project rubric. 

This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded.

uWebSocketIO (mu Web Socket IO details can be found here: https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets) was first installed and setup. This basically helps in craeting a web socket server through which the Unity based simulator and the C++ code talk to each other by communicating through JS object nodes. The main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project top directory.

All the required ".cpp" and ".h" files have been written soa as to get the RMSE values below the allowed threshold for Dataset 1. The "cout" statements written for dubugging purpose have been commented (not deleted) so that in future they can be used for further modifications.
